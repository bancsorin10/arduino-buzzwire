This is an arduino application 

a buzzwire game 

- a double 7 segment display that shows the time you needed to complete the game

connections described in the dispay.ino right on top
int 1 is for win connect it at the end of the wire (not to the wire use another wire or a nailed coin)
both int0 ant int1 pins should be connected with a pull down resistor to prevent anomalies

known issue:
    tried to make a pwm buzzer to sing the marion song while you are playing but activating timer1 influences timer0 and unexpectedly it remains on 00
    the problem persists even if you disable the interruption while in timer0 isr
    sooo the display in timer0 isr works but the values are not incremented and also the pwm works on the first note as i tested
