- a double 7 segment display that shows the time you needed to complete the game

connections described in the display.ino right on top
int 1 is for win connect it at the end of the wire (not to the wire use another wire or a nailed coin)
both int0 ant int1 pins should be connected with a pull down resistor to prevent anomalies

2.make a condition for the 0 notes (we may end up dividing by 0)
